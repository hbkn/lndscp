This document outlines all changes from ADCS 1.0 and details how the functionalities must be used in the capture process.\n\nBelongs to ETRM\nPre-project\nBelgium Germany\n\nAutomatic Deal capture System : interface to automatic deal creation.\nThere is no risk associated to ADCS access, since an access to ZAINET is needed to enter deals: an access to ADCS only is not sufficient"
